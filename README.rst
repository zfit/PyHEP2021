zfit and hepstats PyHEP 2021
================================

The PyHEP talk about zfit and hepstatscovers two main topics:

- first, we will talk about the newest features: the generalisation of the minimizer API and how to use it independently of zfit.
- then we will dive into zfit: from the basics to more advanced concepts including simultaneus fits, constraints and custom models.

To run the notebooks, either download them and install (inside a virtualenv or conda) with

.. code::
 
   pip install -r binder/requirements.txt
   
or they can be run in a binder instance
